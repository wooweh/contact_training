# Aim Trainer

## Introduction

Aim Trainer is a simple, browser-based tool designed to help users improve their mouse movement and click accuracy. It features a simple interface consisting of an instruction page and a training module. The application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and utilizes local storage for saving user performance history.

## Features

- **Instructions Page**: Provides users with guidelines on how to use the application effectively.
- **Training Page**: Includes a practice module where users can start a countdown timer, during which they must click on randomly appearing dots on the screen.
- **Performance Tracking**: After each session, click count and accuracy are recorded and saved to the userâ€™s history.
- **History Bar**: Displays past results in a list format for quick reference.
- **Data Visualization**: A chart that plots the last 10 training results, showing both click count and accuracy.

## Usage

    {
        "clicks": number,
        "accuracy": percentage
    },
    ...
]
```
